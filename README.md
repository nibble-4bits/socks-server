# SOCKS server

Small and straightforward Rust implementation of the SOCKSv5 protocol described in [RFC1928](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1928). I made this to learn more about async programming in Rust.

## Built with

- [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/), as async runtime for handling asynchronous connections.
- [thiserror](https://crates.io/crates/thiserror), for easier handling of dynamic errors.
